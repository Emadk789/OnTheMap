# OnTheMap

# Project Overview
The On The Map app allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing students to place themselves “on the map,” so to speak. 

# What I applied in this project

> - Accessing networked data using Apple’s URL loading framework
> - Authenticating a user using over a network connection
> - Creating user interfaces that are responsive, and communicate network activity
> - Use Core Location and the MapKit framework for to display annotated pins on a map
